# Python Project for Data Science
In this project, you will demonstrate your skills in Python - the language of choice for Data Science and Data Analysis. 
You will apply Python fundamentals, Python data structures, and work with data in Python. 
By working on a real project, you will model a Data Scientist or Data Analyst's role, and build a dashboard using Python and popular Python libraries using Jupyter notebook.

# About this course
This course was designed to provide the building blocks for Python programming and data collection for those choosing a career in Data Science, Data Engineering, AI or Application Development. 

Initially conceived as a foundation course for Data Science and AI it has been refreshed several times to keep pace with emerging career options. Additional content has been added which is applicable to Data Science, Data Engineering, AI or Application Development. 

After completing this course you will have learned foundational skills in Python programming which you can then go on to apply in the Python Project course for your chosen career.  

The Python Project courses involve real world scenarios where you are in charge of a final project as a Data Scientist, a Data Engineer, or in AI and Application Development. By finishing this course and your follow-on Python Project, you will gain the basic skills to continue the steps on your chosen career path.
